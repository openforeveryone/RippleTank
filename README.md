# RippleTank
WebGL Ripple Tank Simulator for Physics Students

Ripple Tank Sim is a wave simulator for demonstrating common wave behaviours that occurs naturally in many media. This ripple tank can exhibit slow propagation of waves that will reflect off walls (and optionally sides), diffract around corners and constructively and destructively interfere to create interference patterns. It is also possible to demonstrate the Doppler effect with a moving point source.

All physics calculations are performed on the GPU using WebGL.
